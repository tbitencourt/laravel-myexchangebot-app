## Installation

### Environment

It is a Laravel (version 8.0) application using an environment in Docker (version 19.03.13) and Docker Compose (version 1.26.0) with the following services:

* PHP 7.4.11
* Nginx 1.18
* MySQL 5.7
* Composer 1.9.1

- Note 1: A "npm" (version 10.19.1) was used to generate webpack with front-end assets, but it is outside the docker.
- Note 2: Despite using the docker, the project can be run on any Ubuntu with the above software installed and configured correctly (I have not tested it on Windows, but I believe it also works).
 
### Project

Step-by-step to configure the project:

1 . Clone "laravel-myexchangebot-app" project from GitHub:

`git clone git@github.com:tbitencourt/laravel-myexchangebot-app.git`

2 . Start docker containers:

`docker-compose up -d`

3 . Open shell from FPM container (next steps must run inside FPM container):

`docker-compose exec fpm sh`

4 . Install backend dependencies via composer:

`composer install -vvv`

3 . Create `.env` file from` .env.example`:

`php -r "file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');"`

6 . Generate Application key:

`php artisan key:generate`

7 . Run migrations and seeders to create the database:

`php artisan migrate --seed`

8 . Configure directory permissions:

`chmod -R 775 storage && chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache`

9 . Exit container:

`exit`

10 . Install frontend dependencies (Laravel Mix) via npm:

`npm install && npm run dev`

11 . Set virtual host:

`echo "127.0.0.1 myexchangebot.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

12 . Place your personal API keys in the `.env` file as an example above*:

*Both are required.

```
## Currency External APIs
DATAFIXER_URL=http://data.fixer.io/api/latest
DATAFIXER_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
AMDOREN_URL=https://www.amdoren.com/api/currency.php
AMDOREN_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```


Now just open the site: 

- http://myexchangebot.local

## Features

In this challenge, several best practices have been implemented, including some design patterns that are not used on Laravel (Ex: Builders, Transfers, Repositories, etc) and clean code. Unfortunately, it was not possible implement all required features however, a complex infrastructure has been created in the backend to guarantee a high level in all implemented features. Are they:

* __Application dockerized__

As mentioned, a complete environment has been set up on the docker for a better development experience.

* __All interactions with bot via chat__

To make easier, a "help" command has been created to list how to use all commands.

* __Currency exchange using given APIs with currency code validation in the cache__

Yes, this application uses both the provided APIs, one to validate currency codes (caching to perform the next searches) and other one to convert. It is very important to configure both APIs keys in `.env` file.

* __Log-in and Sign-in by the bot via chat__

Login working in two steps, one to start the action and get username, and the other to get password securely and log-in the user into the app, changing the username in the chat. I didn't have enough time to finish the sign-in.

* __Logged user perform money transactions and all transaction's related features__

Had no enough time to develop this feature.

* __Pre-registered user__

There are Seeders to store an Admin user and all chatbot hints.

## Conclusion

Thanks for the opportunity and any questions just ask me. :)
